## Description

Research on the formation of habits has found that the duration for the formation of habits varies dramatically, with the average being [66 days](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674). Therefore, 66 days was chosen to represent a reasonable time frame as a goal, which more importantly sets a realistic expectation for how long it takes to incorporate a habit into one's lifestyle.


### Creating Habits

Users can create a habit that they wish to form in order to keep themselves accountable and provide a space to detail the specifics of what their goals are and why they wish to form that habit.


### Checking In

Users check in with their habits daily in order to keep track of their progress, marking that habit as completed for the day.


### Habit Info

Clicking on a habit displays useful information about the progress of the habit, 
including the current streak (how many consecutive days has the user checked in) and a 
graph detailing the user's checkins over time. Here, the user can send a request to another user 
to link their habits with one another. If the other user accepts, each user can see whether or not
the other has checked in for the day in order to keep each other accountable.


### Profile

The user profile page gives a general overview of the current progress on their habits, as well as some 
other stats that they may find useful. The inbox is also located in the profile page, where users can accept 
or decline requests to link habits.
